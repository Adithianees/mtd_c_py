-->arthematic operators : + - * /
-->all are binary operators 
-->i/p are numbers
-->o/p are numbers 
-->used with infix notation 
-->to perform any arthematic operation , DT of both the operands must be same 
-->left to right associtivity w.r.t resding the values/expressions
-->for the calculation to happen,the user/programmer given infix expression must be converted to postfix.
-->the operators have different heirarchy (precedence)
----------------------------------------------------------------
relational operators :>< == != >= <=

for int i=1; i<=10; i++
for int i=1; i<=11; i++
[10,20]
num>=10 and num<=20
